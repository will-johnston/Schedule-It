Non-Functional Testing (performance and usability): 
Performance:
	-with multiple, high-quality gifs in the same chat, runs  with litte(unseen) to no latency

Scalability:
	-images dont scale according to chat window, small images work fine, large images create horizontal scroll bars

Usability: 
	-not able to put text and link to gif or images on the same line, images and gifs must be on a separate line
	-cant put multiple links on the same line
